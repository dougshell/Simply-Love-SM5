I questioned absolutely everything that was default in the ITG2 theme.\" Indeed, it was a stark departure from other theming efforts of the time, and became an instant hit.\n\nLara is a world-class Pump It Up player, and has represented the US at WPF multiple times. Most recently, she has designed the UI for Rhythm Horizon."

			About="Paul provided support when I needed it, and helped make Simply Love more robust by testing odd combinations of things that would never have occurred to me otherwise.\n\nFor example, placing a reasonable upper limit on user-input strings: maybe it's a good idea, maybe sometimes it's not. Maybe players SHOULD be allowed to put whatever they want as the DisplayName in Editable.ini.  Maybe Simply Love SHOULDN'T do anything to keep string length in check. Who's really to say? Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the mines and arrows of Ride, or to take arms against a sea of memes, and by opposing what I am doing?"
